The extension is implemented for Chome (with blocking capability) and Firefox.

## Manual of Use

Once the extension is successfully installed, you can check if a website is loading a Fingerprinting script by just visiting it normally. In the positive case, a message will prop up describing the provider and the URL of the script.
